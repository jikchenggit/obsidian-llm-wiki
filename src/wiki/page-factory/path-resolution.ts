// resolution logic and the LLM candidate-list shape are independently
// testable.
//
// Behavior (v1.24.1 Phase 2 refactor — preserved verbatim):
//   - resolvePagePath: exact-slug fast path → ConflictResolver (same-type
//     slug/alias match) → LLM semantic dedup fallback. Issue #472 both ways:
//     the opposite folder never decides deterministically — in neither
//     direction. A cross-folder slug/alias hit routes the resolution through
//     the semantic dedup call with that page in the candidate list: merging on
//     it blindly mistakes a shared designator for a shared referent (the KHK
//     case), ignoring it blindly mints a twin page whenever the extraction
//     types the same referent differently across notes (measured: 18 twin
//     pairs in one 83-note batch, every one the same referent).
//   - buildPagesListForPrompt: filters out sources/ by default (#234) and
//     polluted basenames (L2); caps at MAX_PAGES=50 with entity/concept
//     bias based on includePaths; emits a "(truncated)" suffix when the cap
//     fires; optionally appends includePaths that aren't already in the
//     list.
