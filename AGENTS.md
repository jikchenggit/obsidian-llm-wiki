## 🛡️ Six-Gate Quality Closure

| Gate | Constraint | How |
|------|-----------|-----|
| **1. Code correct** | `pnpm lint` 0/0 + `npx tsc --noEmit` 0/0 + `pnpm build` clean + `pnpm test` all pass + `pnpm css-lint` 0 | Five-Gate script (build BEFORE test — see §"Gate 1: Five-Gate automated") |
| **2. No side effects** | Call-site audit + data flow + state mutation + error propagation | Structured review |
| **3. No breaking changes** | API/Schema/File format/Default behavior/Command IDs/Obsidian API | Breaking-change matrix |
| **4. No performance regression** | CPU/memory/IO/network/token — 5-dim written assessment | simplify + code-review + Gate 4 table |
| **5. Docs complete** | 10 READMEs + ROADMAP + AGENTS + CHANGELOG + memory | pre-release-gate |
| **6. Release clean** | Supersets 1-5 + TOC + i18n + Release Notes + Contributors + git hygiene | pre-release-gate |

### Gate 1: Five-Gate automated

```bash
pnpm lint && npx tsc --noEmit && pnpm build && pnpm test && pnpm css-lint
```

All five must pass. ESLint checks style, TypeScript checks types, css-lint checks Obsidian review compliance — three complementary checks, single tool passing is insufficient. No `@ts-ignore` / `eslint-disable` to silence failures.

**Order is non-negotiable**: `pnpm build` MUST run before `pnpm test`. The test suite contains build-artifact verifications (e.g. `src/__tests__/llm-sdk/openai-codex-loopback-flow.test.ts:39` reads `main.js` to assert the esbuild bundle shape), so a test-first run fails with ENOENT on a fresh clone. Local Gate 1 typically has `main.js` on disk from a prior `pnpm build:dev`, which is why this ordering bug was missed before PR #487's first CI run on 2026-08-18.

**Bot alignment (pre-release):** local `pnpm lint` ≠ Obsidian review bot. Bot runs newer `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd`. Before each release:
```bash
LOCAL=$(node -p "require('./node_modules/eslint-plugin-obsidianmd/package.json').version")
LATEST=$(npm view eslint-plugin-obsidianmd version)
[ "$LOCAL" != "$LATEST" ] && pnpm add -D "eslint-plugin-obsidianmd@$LATEST" && rm -f pnpm-lock.yaml && pnpm install && npm install --legacy-peer-deps --package-lock-only && pnpm lint
```

### Gate 2: No Side Effects

For each modified function, trace: **call-site audit** (`grep -rn "<fn>" src/`) → **data flow** (input origin → output destination → side effects) → **state mutation** (concurrent safety? overwrite vs append?) → **error propagation** (new error paths caught by all callers?). Deliverable: 3-5 sentence assessment.

### Gate 3: No Breaking Changes

| Dimension | Check | Pass criteria |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| API signature | `git diff` + `grep` | All call-sites updated; no new required params without defaults |
| Settings schema | `types.ts` + `settings.ts` | New fields have defaults; removed fields ignored |
| File format | Generation templates | Old files load without error |
| Default behavior | Constructor / config init | Old behavior preserved unless opted in |
| Command/setting IDs | `grep` for IDs | IDs unchanged |
| Obsidian API | `manifest.json` | `minAppVersion` >= current |

Deliverable: "None detected" or specific migration plan.

### Gate 4: No Performance Regression

Procedure: (1) Run `simplify` (3 parallel agents); (2) Run `code-review` (max effort); (3) Walk through 5 dimensions below; (4) If regression → mitigate or escalate; (5) If N/A → state so.

| # | Dimension | Project-specific signal |
|---|-----------|-------------------------|
| 1 | CPU | `O(n²) candidate generation` is known risk — do not regress |
| 2 | Memory | `thinkingControlCache` bounded by user count; `Map<string, PageMeta>` in `generateDuplicateCandidates` holds all pages |
| 3 | IO | `vault.read()` per page in loops is expensive |
| 4 | Network | `OpenAICompatibleClient.createMessage` should cache 400-fallback (Issue #245); lint dedup budget 500 |
| 5 | Token | Ingest 1-3K; lint dedup 100 × ~30 = 3K/batch; retries = full prompt |

**Deliverable** (mandatory in commit body):
```
## Gate 4: Performance

| Dim | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| CPU | ✅/⚠️/N/A | ... |
| Memory | ✅/⚠️/N/A | ... |
| IO | ✅/⚠️/N/A | ... |
| Network | ✅/⚠️/N/A | ... |
| Token | ✅/⚠️/N/A | ... |
```
Bare "no regression" is **not acceptable**.

### Gate 5 + Gate 6

Gate 6 supersets Gates 1-5 plus release hygiene. `pre-release-gate` skill (release Step 4a) re-runs Gate 1 + all Gate 4 dimensions (Gate 6 must re-verify perf at release time, not trust commit-time).

### ⚠️ Anti-patterns

- "The tests pass, so it's fine" → Tests only cover what you thought to test
- "It's just a one-line change" → Most dangerous
- "I'll add tests later" → Tests must accompany change
- "The PR review will catch it" → Reviewer has less context than you
- "ESLint passes, TypeScript errors are fine" → ESLint does NOT check type safety

---

## 🧪 Development Quality Closure (TDD + Planning)

Mandatory loop for every code change. This is a closure, not a checklist — each step depends on the previous.

```
1. Deep thinking    → What is the problem? Edge cases? Failure modes?
2. Plan             → Files to change, function signatures, side effects
3. Write test       → Failing test that defines expected behavior
4. Confirm RED      → Run test, verify it fails for the right reason
5. Implement        → Minimum code to make the test pass
6. Confirm GREEN    → Run test, verify it passes
7. Refactor         → Clean up; tests must still pass
8. 4-Gate verify    → lint + tsc + test + build + css-lint all clean
9. Six-Gate review  → side effects + breaking + performance + doc + release
```

**Tests required** for: new exported function/class/module, new behavior branch (any new if/else), **bug fixes** (test reproduces bug; fix makes test pass), refactor with observable behavior change. Tests optional for: pure config, type-only, docs. Pre-existing code with zero tests: add at least one test for the changed path first.

**Shell-test anti-pattern (2026-06-02, Issue #81):** tests that pass without verifying real behavior are **worse than no test**. Rules:
1. Cover ALL production code paths (inline vs multi-line, JSON vs YAML, etc.)
2. Assert content mutation, not just return values (`output !== input` AND `output` contains new content)
3. Re-scan assertion for idempotency tests (re-invoke detector on output)
4. Inspect actual output during debugging — don't trust GREEN without seeing it

## 🔀 Git Branch Workflow (enforced since v1.20.2)

**Core principle:** Never develop directly on main. Main only accepts PR merges.

```
main (protected) ────► tag → release
  │
  ├── feat/xxx ── PR → review → merge
  └── fix/xxx  ── PR → review → merge
```

**Per-fix E2E handoff + explicit push approval (added 2026-08-14, post #456 incident):**

1. Branch from main (`git checkout -b feat/xxx` or `fix/xxx`)
2. RED test → GREEN fix → 4-Gate green (per TDD closure)
3. **Local commit** (`git commit`, no push yet)
4. **`pnpm build:dev`** → verify artifacts (`tail -1 main.js` ends with sourcemap; `console.debug` preserved; 3 output files exist)
5. **Report to user** — root cause + file:line + diff + test delta + 6-Gate table
6. **Wait for explicit "可以 push" / "push it" / "ship it"** before `git push` + `gh pr create`
7. **Wait for explicit "merge it" / "合并"** before `gh pr merge`

**Prohibited:** committing directly on main · pushing PR without user confirmation · mixing unrelated changes · fragmented commits (amend instead) · **`git push` + `gh pr create` immediately after Gate 1 passes** (must do E2E handoff + explicit approval first) · **`gh pr merge` after PR created** (must wait for explicit signal).

**When to amend vs new commit:** fixing a problem in previous commit → `--amend`; new feature/fix → new commit; pre-release doc updates → can amend into version bump commit.

### ⚠️ Git Safety Protocol

- **NEVER commit or push without explicit user permission.** Non-negotiable.
- **NEVER auto-merge PRs.** Not even when Gate 1 passed in CI, or the fix looks "obviously correct", or user said "handle it".
- **Mandatory pre-merge workflow:** (1) user explicit "merge it" / "合并" required before `gh pr merge` / cherry-pick / PR-creation; (2) `simplify` skill runs on PR diff (4 angles); (3) `code-review` skill runs (8 angles, max effort); (4) report findings as `file:line + concrete issue + suggested fix` — do NOT modify the PR; (5) wait for approval before any destructive action.
- **Anti-patterns:** "the PR is small, let me cherry-pick to local main first while we discuss" (violates workflow, creates commits ahead of approval); "Gate 1 passes, so I can `git push` + `gh pr create` immediately" (skips E2E handoff — see #456 incident above).

### Maintainer tooling: two failure modes that read as something else (2026-09-13)

**`gh auth refresh` needs `--hostname` when not running interactively.** Without it the command prints **usage text** — the real error (`--hostname required when not running interactively`) sits above the flags list and is easy to read as "the flags were wrong". Correct form, safe to background so the device code can be surfaced before the browser step:

```bash
nohup gh auth refresh --hostname github.com -s workflow > /tmp/ghauth.log 2>&1 &
sleep 10 && cat /tmp/ghauth.log   # → one-time code + https://github.com/login/device
```

The device flow needs the human; the code expires in ~15 min. Once authorised, `gh auth status` shows the added scope and the merge can proceed.

**A workflow-file merge reports branch policy, not the scope problem.** Merging a PR that touches `.github/workflows/*` fails with `the base branch policy prohibits the merge`, which reads as "a requirement is still missing" — it isn't. Adding `--admin` (or using the REST `PUT /pulls/<N>/merge` endpoint) surfaces the actual cause: `refusing to allow an OAuth App to create or update workflow ... without 'workflow' scope`, HTTP 403. The ruleset has no bypass actors (`rulesets/16884813`, "Protect main branch", active — one call re-checks the claim), so `--admin` does **not** bypass it — it only stops masking it. The variable is **whether the token carried `workflow` at that moment**, not the shape of the change: #693 added a step and merged, #639 changed a step and sat on the wall, #698 added a trigger and sat on the wall. Same shape, opposite outcomes — and the two that failed were merged nine seconds apart, six hours after the one that did not, which is the signature of one unblocking event. So the error is the only reliable signal. Do not report a PR as merge-ready until one of the two paths has returned a merge commit.

### Per-PR discipline

For contributor PRs that need rebase after base-branch move: use `gh pr update-branch --rebase` — NEVER locally fork + push + create a new PR. See [[feedback_pr_merge_credit_preservation]].

**Mandatory merge sequence (added 2026-08-18):** every merge MUST follow this exact order. Skipping any step is a procedural miss even when content review passed:

```
gh pr view <N> --json title,body --jq '.title, .body' | grep -inE '\b(closes?|closed|fix(es|ed)?|resolve[sd]?)\s+#[0-9]+'   # ← scan FIRST; every hit must be an issue you mean to close
gh pr review <N> --body "<file>"   # ← MANDATORY. Formal review event lands on the PR.
gh pr merge <N> --admin --squash --delete-branch   # ← ONLY after user said "merge it"
```

- **A PR body is not the commit-message file.** `git log` wants ~80-column wrapping; GitHub renders a single newline in a PR or issue body as a **hard break**, so a wrapped paragraph arrives on the web as a column of ~80-character fragments. Same content, two renderings: write the body with one long line per paragraph and let the page reflow it, and keep the commit message wrapped. The symptom reappears whenever `--body-file` is handed the same file that was passed to `git commit -F`. Caught 2026-09-16 on #733. Check before posting — `awk 'length>0 && length<88' <body-file>` should return only markdown-structure lines (headings, list items, table rows), never prose.

- **Scan the body before merging.** A closing keyword needs no intent and does
  not have to aim at an issue. Writing the fix reference as prose — "its fix
  #684" — parsed as `fix #684` and closed **PR #684** one second after the PR
  carrying that sentence merged. The author never touched it, and the ROI
  board merged in that same PR listed #684 as an unblock-first item. Recover
  with `gh pr reopen <N>`; see MEMORY.md §"Issue close keyword".

- **`gh pr review --approve` (or `--request-changes`) MUST be posted BEFORE `gh pr merge`.** This lands the formal review verdict on the PR timeline; downstream tooling (release notes, contributor credit, audit trail) reads from that event, not from comments.
- For architect-level contributor PRs (e.g. @DocTpoint), per [[feedback_reply_brevity_for_architect_contributors]]: review body should be **decision + ≤5 sentences** + concrete `file:line` findings, not a long-form audit.
- **Post-merge audit trail:** if a `gh pr merge` was executed without the matching `--approve` event (procedural miss, not content miss), immediately post `gh pr comment <N> --body <audit-note>` recording what was skipped. Don't rebase, don't re-merge, don't amend — the merge commit hash stands; only the audit trail is patched. Incident reference: PR #478 (2026-08-18, merge `2806d24`).
- Anti-pattern: "`gh pr merge --admin` doesn't enforce reviews, so I can skip --approve." Wrong — `--admin` bypasses the **requirement** rule, not the **review event** rule. Two separate audit surfaces.

**Reviewing PRs (added 2026-09-12, after #570):** a PR decided against is **closed** once the contributor has had a fair window to answer (roughly two weeks of silence), with the decision comment naming in one line what would reopen it. An open PR states that merging is still possible — a closed one cannot collect a stray review at all.

**Filing issues (added 2026-09-17, after #735 / #736):** an issue whose premise is a *missing capability* must name that capability as its acceptance criteria — or not be filed yet. Filing "X has no Y path" and then building Y in the next PR without linking them produces an issue that reads as unstarted work while the work is under review; a PR body written in between can even call the delivered capability "the open question", which is how it happened here. Link at the moment implementation starts (`Closes #N` in the body). And when an issue's own analysis turns out to be wrong, **record the correction on the issue rather than editing it away** — the route that was not needed is information about why the right one was cheap (#735 proposed a bespoke adapter; the bundled `@ai-sdk/openai.responses()` meant the work was a routing decision).

Every review submission MUST begin with the signal check:

```
gh pr view <N> --json labels,comments --jq '{labels: [.labels[].name], last_comments: [.comments[] | "\(.author.login) \(.createdAt[0:10]): \(.body[0:120])"][-3:]}'   # ← check FIRST
gh pr review <N> --body "<file>"   # ← ONLY when the check above returned no signal
```

Two ways to get that check wrong, both caught in review of its first version: `.[0:1]` returns the **oldest** comment rather than the latest — decisions arrive late, so it hides exactly what it is looking for — and filtering on one account's login makes a decision written by any other maintainer invisible. Take the last few comments from **any** author.

If a signal is present, post a short comment asking instead of a review. To undo a misfired review: dismiss it (`PUT .../pulls/<N>/reviews/<id>/dismissals`) and, if the PR is `wontfix`, convert it to draft via `convertPullRequestToDraft` (REST's `draft` field is GitHub-App-only; `gh` has no `pr draft`). MEMORY.md §"Declined PRs are closed, not left open".

## 📦 Development Workflow

```bash
pnpm gate:1                    # Gate 1: lint + typecheck + test + build + css-lint (preferred)
pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm typecheck && pnpm build && pnpm css-lint   # WRONG ORDER — see §"Gate 1: Five-Gate automated"; build must precede test
```

`pnpm gate:1` is a composite alias added 2026-08-18; both forms are equivalent. Prefer `pnpm gate:1` for one-shot local verification.

### Gate 1 CI (added 2026-08-18)

`.github/workflows/pr-ci.yml` runs the full Five-Gate on every PR to `main` and on every push to `main` (the second trigger added 2026-09-12: a PR is green against the base it branched from, so a break that exists only in the merged pair is invisible until a later PR reports it). Status check: `Gate 1 / Five-Gate`. Branch protection requires it (`strict: false`, `require_last_push_approval: false`).

CI is a **defense-in-depth** layer on top of the per-fix E2E handoff manual Gate 1 (which is still required before `git push`). CI does NOT enable auto-merge — explicit "merge it" / "合并" still required per §"⚠️ Git Safety Protocol".

Obsidian Bot review remains a separate pipeline (not a GitHub status check); CI green ≠ Bot-approved. See `feedback_obsidian_bot_double_lint` for the double-lint invariant.

Lockfile-pinned install (`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`) prevents `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd` drift between local Gate 1 and CI; the Bot alignment step at release time remains the final word on plugin version per "Bot alignment (pre-release)" under §"Gate 1: Five-Gate automated". `npm ci` is intentionally NOT used (project pins `pnpm@10.14.0`; pnpm `overrides` are flat and npm cannot honor them per `feedback_pnpm_vs_npm_overrides_incompatibility`).

### Build modes

- `pnpm build` — **production** build (console.debug stripped, no sourcemap). For release.
- `pnpm build:dev` — **debug** build (inline sourcemap + console.debug preserved). When user requests local test build.
- `pnpm dev` — **watch** mode.

When user says "build local debug file for testing":
1. Run `pnpm build:dev` → outputs `main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`
2. Verify `main.js` ends with `//# sourceMappingURL=data:application/json;base64,...`
3. Confirm `console.debug` is NOT replaced

For full release workflow (commit + push + tag + release notes), use the `obsidian-plugin-release` skill. Canonical path under Pi: `~/.pi/skills/obsidian-plugin-release/SKILL.md`. Legacy alias `~/.claude/skills/obsidian-plugin-release/SKILL.md` still works under Claude Code sessions. **Main branch is protected** — direct pushes rejected with `GH013`.

---

## ✅ Pre-Release Checklist

Use `obsidian-plugin-release` skill for the full workflow (Steps 1-8). Gate 1 must all pass before any commit. Pre-release hardening (lockfile regen, CI consistency, AI-SDK drift): [[feedback_build_verification_root_cause]]. Doc review sweep: `doc-review` skill (PASS/WARN/FAIL).

---

## ⚠️ Development Protocol: Plan First, Then Execute

**Before any significant change** (refactoring, new modules, prompt modification, architectural decisions, anything touching core engine files):

1. Present your plan — explain what, why, how
2. Wait for explicit user approval before writing code or committing
3. For multi-phase work: pause and report after each phase

**Exceptions** (no prior approval needed): trivial one-line fixes, running lint/test/build, reading files, documenting existing code.

Full protocol: [[feedback_development_protocol]].

---

## ⚠️ Editor Discipline — No Bulk Scripts for Code or Documents

Every change via `Read` + `Edit` — no sed/awk/python for code or document editing. (2026-06-11: a brace-matching Python script broke 3 sites that 4-Gate passed — wrong lexical block in `query-engine.ts`, unsafe `this: any` in lint modules.)

**Document editing rules (2026-06-24 post-mortem):**
- **Read before Edit — always.** Know exact 5+ lines context before constructing `old_string`.
- **Verify with `git diff`** after every multi-file edit pass (check unintended deletions).
- **grep alone is NOT sufficient** — grep tells you *where* a pattern exists, not what surrounds it. Always Read full context before Edit.
- **Verify idempotency** — surrounding content intact, no swallowed bullets, no broken headings.

---

## 📋 Karpathy Philosophy Compliance

- **Knowledge compounds** — query results flow back into wiki
- **Human-in-the-loop** — LLM suggests, user decides
- **Three-layer architecture** — Sources → Wiki → Schema
- **Incremental accumulation** — wiki is persistent, not one-shot

## 🎯 Python Zen Design Principles

- **Simple > Complex** — comment not framework
- **Flat > Nested** — linear code beats micro-methods
- **Solve when it hurts** — don't optimize before measuring
- **Explicit > Implicit** — function types ARE documentation

## 🌍 Internationalization

- **UI**: 11 locales (EN canonical + 10 translations: ZH/ZH-Hant/JA/KO/DE/FR/ES/PT/IT/RU), 277+ fields per locale. Locale list lives in `src/texts/`.
- **Wiki output**: 11 languages independent of UI + custom input option
- **Code**: English only, minimal comments
- **User-facing strings** = user language, not implementation language

## 📋 Git Commit Standards

English, conventional commits: `feat:` `fix:` `docs:` `refactor:` `test:` `chore:`

**Auto-close:** append `Closes #N` (or `Fixes #N` / `Resolves #N`) to commit body. NEVER use `gh issue close` or UI close — let the commit message do it.

**Author identity:** canonical `green-dalii <654534332@qq.com>`. NEW commits (incl. `--amend` and squash) MUST use lowercase canonical form. **Maintainer commits DO NOT include any AI-generated trailer** — no `Co-Authored-By:`, no `Generated with`, no equivalent marker from **any** AI agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Pi, …). AI tooling may legitimately assist authoring, but the commit's audit trail must read as a single human author (per [[feedback_co_authored_by_format]]). External contributors write their own trailers — preserve verbatim on merge.

**A squash merge is how a contributor's trailer reaches a maintainer commit (2026-09-20).** GitHub's squash message concatenates the branch's commit messages, so any trailer on any branch commit lands in the squash commit — whose `author` is the **PR author**, not the merger, which is why the rule is not "do not write a trailer" but "**read the message you are about to commit**". Found by auditing `main`: three commits authored by the maintainer carry `Co-Authored-By: Claude Code`, all three squash merges of his own PRs from 2026-08-30/31, all three unrewritable (protected `main`, released history). One of them is `e054012d` — *"docs: remove Claude residue from process docs; AGENTS.md becomes canonical"* — the commit whose subject is clearing Claude residue. So: before `gh pr merge --squash`, run the trailer scan against the **draft message**, not against the branch. When the branch carries one and the contributor owns it, prefer `--subject`/`--body` (or edit in the UI) so the trailer stays on the contributor's own work and off the merger's.

```bash
git log origin/main..HEAD --format=%B | grep -inE '^(co-authored-by|generated with|signed-off-by|assisted-by):'   # → must be empty for YOUR commits
```

**A maintainer-invoked `gh pr update-branch --rebase` rewrites the contributor's commit identity.** It rebases with the invoker's credentials, so every rebased commit keeps its `author` but takes `committer = maintainer` — verified on #656 (2026-09-20): five commits went from `committer=Jan Heldal` to `committer=Greener-Dalii`. Credit is not lost (`author` drives the contributors graph and `git log --author`), and a squash merge discards it entirely, so this is not a correctness problem — but it *is* a visible artifact on someone else's commits, and the alternative (merging `main` into the branch) leaves their identity untouched. Choose deliberately rather than by habit.

**Verify the commit, not the command.** A commit that reports success can still carry the wrong content. `git commit --amend -F <msg>` without a prior `git add` commits the *message* plus whatever was already staged — so a fix made immediately before it is left behind while the message announces it. That is worse than a missing commit: the description disagrees with the contents, so a reader who diffs the change concludes they misread, and the audit trail itself is what got corrupted. Two habits close it — `git status --porcelain` must be **empty** immediately after every commit, and amending to change content means `git add` first (use `--no-edit` when the message is already right). Confirm with `git show HEAD:<path>`, or re-read the branch from GitHub, rather than trusting the exit code. Caught 2026-09-17 on #736, whose body announced a preset-ordering fix its diff did not contain.

## 🔑 Key Design Decisions (rules + pointers)

The following rules are documented as **canonical references** (memory files / specific commits). Brief statement here; full detail in pointer.

### 🚫 Dead-code-as-docs policy (v1.26.0 Batch 4)

Dead code (exported symbols with zero production importers) has a **half-life of one release cycle**. Wire or delete before the next MINOR ships. Do not ship dead code across two releases. `pre-release-gate` Phase 2g enforces this. Hard rule: "ship it dead, wire it next release" = you've already lost — file the wire-up in the same PR or wait. Memory: [[feedback_dead_code_as_docs]].

### ⚠️ Settings panel scope rule (v1.26.0 Batch 2 lesson)

Two settings panels:
1. **LLM Advanced section** (`src/ui/settings-sections/advanced-section.ts`, gated by `advancedSettingsMode`) — `temperature`, `repetitionPenalty`, `forcePdfSupport`, `taskPolicies` (per-task output-mode/thinking spec, PR #525) ONLY.
2. **Bottom "Advanced settings" panel** (`src/ui/settings-sections/advanced-settings-section.ts`, gated by `showAdvancedSettings`) — lint dedup thresholds, `maxConversationHistory`, `writePdfMarkdownToVault`, `slugCase`, `createWelcomeNote`, `lintDedupIncludeSources`, all per-source-file/UI/storage toggles.

**Hard rule:** when adding a setting toggle, decide FIRST which scope. LLM Advanced = LLM sampling + provider overrides ONLY. Everything else → bottom panel. Post-mortem: [[feedback_settings_panel_naming_collision]].

### ⚠️ Force-disable thinking (v1.26.0 Batches 2/6/7 + PR #411)

Use `enableThinking: false` on `createMessage` call. Layer 1 (`reasoningEffort: 'none'`) + Layer 3 (400-retry via `reasoning-strip-probe.ts`) + Layer 4 (prompt-level "do not reason step by step") cover all known backends. **Never write `thinking.type` or `chat_template_kwargs` into provider options on the openai-compat path today** — AI SDK zod silently drops them. Wire-body regression test: `openai-compat-request-body.test.ts` asserts `reasoning_effort: 'none'` IS on the body.

Per-call policy (PR #411 F5-B): source-analyzer parent (`source-analyzer.ts:386`) honors; **JSON-repair (`source-analyzer.ts:417`) does NOT honor** — repair needs reasoning budget to understand broken-JSON semantics, disabling produces structurally-valid-but-wrong content. Regression guard in `source-analyzer-thinking.test.ts` (inverted).

Full post-mortem chain (979s → 365s → 151s on 2141-page vault): [[feedback_force_disable_thinking_openai_compat_noop]] + [[feedback_force_disable_thinking_dedup_wiring]] + [[feedback_dedup_phase_halving_dead_code]] + [[feedback_dedup_phase_truncation_vs_empty_conflation]].

### ⚠️ LLM empty-response retry

v1.26.0 Batch 2 added empty-response retry + transient concurrency halving inline in `runDedupPhase`. Mechanism is provider-agnostic (200 + 0-byte body under burst load). User-facing Toast uses reusable i18n key `llmRetryRecoveredToast`. **Extract on second use** — every future LLM business path needs retry + backoff + halving + log + Notice, not re-implemented. Current inline form is ~80 LOC. Extraction plan: [[feedback_llm_retry_extraction]] → `src/core/llm-retry.ts` with `callLlmWithRetry<T>(client, args, opts)` and `LlmRetryOptions { maxAttempts, delayMs, inScanConcurrencyFloor, onRetry, onRecovered }`.

### ⚠️ Obsidian Plugin Submission Rules — `document` is forbidden

`document` (the bare global) is **strictly forbidden** in production code. Obsidian is multi-window — `document` may refer to the wrong window. Only valid reference: **`activeDocument`**. `obsidianmd/prefer-active-doc` is no-disable in the Obsidian Community Plugin review pipeline — the review bot will reject regardless of `// eslint-disable-next-line` comment.

Test-environment differences must be solved in test setup, not production code. Stub `activeDocument` in `src/__tests__/__support__/setup.ts`:
```typescript
(globalThis as Record<string, unknown>).activeDocument = globalThis.document;
```
Production code uses `activeDocument` directly — no fallback, no eslint-disable comments.

### ⚠️ Codex OAuth provider architecture

- `openai` = OpenAI Platform API-key provider (separate billing).
- `openai-codex` = **ChatGPT Plan (Codex OAuth)** — experimental third-party compatibility, NOT an OpenAI partnership.
- Desktop supports OpenAI-hosted browser flow via loopback callback on `127.0.0.1:1455`; desktop + mobile support device-code login. Node `http` loading MUST stay behind `Platform.isDesktop` guard.
- **OAuth credentials remain in Obsidian SecretStorage only.** Never in settings, `data.json`, logs, Notices, docs, test fixtures, copied examples. Sign-out overwrites the plugin-owned secret with empty value + clears in-memory state.
- Provider uses dedicated Codex Responses client + synchronizes picker-visible models from authenticated Codex `/models` catalog with sanitized metadata caching + minimal fallback.
- Lifecycle commands: `main-commands/codex-auth-commands.ts`. Shared model selection policy: `core/openai-codex-model-policy.ts`. Codex request adapter intentionally omits client-side `max_output_tokens` (backend doesn't support it).
- SecretStorage requires Obsidian 1.11.4 — `manifest.json`/badges/prerequisites must NOT advertise older minimum. Plugin stays `isDesktopOnly: false` (device-code login is mobile path).

### ⚠️ Obsidian Bot compliance invariant

Hard-won rules (applies to ALL future code):

1. **Bot runs independent `obsidianmd/recommended` ruleset** — your local `eslint.config.mjs` cannot turn off Bot's hard barriers.
2. **`obsidianmd/*` is no-disable by default** — specifically `no-nodejs-modules`, `settings-tab/prefer-setting-definitions`, `no-global-this`, `prefer-active-doc`. Local config may try to relax; Bot rejects inline `eslint-disable`.
3. **`@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-*` propagates through function boundaries** — `const x: T = require(...)` does NOT satisfy the linter (inspects expression return types, not annotations).
4. **Standard Node.js API patterns that work:**
   - Node built-ins: `await import('node:module')` (dynamic) inside `if (!Platform.isDesktop) throw ...` guard. Static `import` of node built-ins unconditionally rejected.
   - Type-safe require: `module.createRequire(__filename)` (Node 15+ official API) — use for typed `node:http` etc. instead of bare `require()`.
   - `__filename` / `__dirname` need inline `eslint-disable no-undef` (legal per-line, not in Bot's no-restricted-disable list).
5. **`obsidianmd/no-nodejs-modules` exemption = `Platform.isDesktop` AST guard**, NOT "dynamic import" — read the rule source. Canonical form: **function-start `if (!Platform.isDesktop) throw`** (mirror `src/llm-sdk/openai-codex/loopback-flow.ts`). Never use `await import(<computed>)` to dodge — yields `any` → `no-unsafe-call` Error (worse than warning). See [[feedback_obsidianmd_no_nodejs_guard_detection]].
6. **Bot scans the whole repo `.ts` tree, not just `src/`** — local `pnpm lint` is `eslint src/`; root `tsconfig.json` includes only `src/**`. Both blind to `tools/`. v1.26.2 (PR #442) closed the blocking Error + type-safety items; remaining tools/ warnings are **accepted-structural** (static `node:fs/path/...` imports, `console.log`, `globalThis` shim, `.obsidian` literal). Run `pnpm lint:tools-bot` (v1.26.2+, informational, exits 0) to see Bot's view locally.

### ⚠️ Per-step LLM accounting

`createMessage` takes an optional `task`, read in one place (`wrapWithAdvancedSettings`) and accumulated in `core/llm-task-usage.ts`. A call site that omits it is filed under `'untagged'` rather than dropped — an unlabelled call still costs time, and a table that hid it would under-report the run it exists to explain. So `'untagged'` is a hole in that table, not a default to settle for: **a new `createMessage` call site picks a label**, named for the step rather than the module.

### ⚠️ SecretStorage / plaintext wipe ordering (Issue #339, v1.25.4 invariant)

When migrating a value from plaintext into an external store (SecretStorage, keychain, OS credential manager), the plaintext MUST survive until IO succeeds. Two-phase: (1) detect + stash plaintext on a transient field (no wipe), (2) wipe plaintext ONLY after IO write returns success. `flushApiKey`-style helpers return `boolean` and calling UI (`PluginSettingTab.hide()`, etc.) MUST skip the commit step on failure. Silent-skip on IO failure = "both stores empty" = user locked out. Memory: [[feedback_secret_storage_platform_failure_pattern]].

### ⚠️ Schema 三层分离 (Issue #328, Phase 1 active 2026-07-22 — Option A)

Knowledge-conservation principle (anti-drift). Each layer owns its half, **never overlap, can never conflict**:

| Layer | Owned by | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **User domain knowledge** | You | `schema/config.md` — page templates, content rules, naming conventions, merge policies |
| **Runtime parameters** | Plugin (Settings) | Tag vocabulary, folder layout, output language, page-type registration — **never written into schema file**, always injected at call time via `getSchemaContext()` |
| **Engine facts** | Code | Model name, API key, thinking mode, `WIKI_SUBFOLDERS` — shipped with the plugin |

**Hard rule:** schema file MUST NOT bake runtime parameters. MUST remain pure user domain knowledge. Adding/expanding the runtime injection layer (`buildActiveTagVocabularySection` and future `buildActiveFolderLayoutSection`) is the only legitimate home for things the Settings panel controls. Violating reintroduces the dual-source problem (Phase 1 was approved specifically to eliminate this drift class).

Rationale: [[feedback-schema-phase1-option-a-decision]] + Issue #328 + [[feedback-schema-template-programmatic-injection]].

### ⚠️ Complementary memory model (v1.26.0 design anchor — #358)

Plugin exposes a **complementary query surface**, not fidelity-to-source maximization. Source notes = episodic memory (verbatim, lossy-never-intended); wiki pages = semantic memory (consolidated, graph-traversable).

**Hard rule:** plugin MUST NOT attempt to make wiki pages win every query. When a user complains "the raw note beats the wiki for query X", the answer is *"that is the division of labour — the wiki serves a different query"*, not "fix the wiki to win X". **Practical implications:** "self-improving over time" = periodic consolidation pass with LLM judgement on past decisions, NOT a smarter ingest path. Smallest kernel of Karpathy cycle = Preview-Confirm gate + identity ambiguity record + stable mutation interface, NOT an agent framework refactor.

Planning: [ROADMAP §v1.27.0 MINOR track](./ROADMAP.md#v1270-minor-design-track). Rationale: #330 reply comment + #358 tracking issue.

### ⚠️ Architect-level contributors (v1.26.0+)

See [MEMORY.md §"Architect-level contributors"](./MEMORY.md#architect-level-contributors) and §"Key Design Decisions" below for definition, role, scope, DocTpoint case study. The project keeps no per-agent private memory directory; the only durable record is [MEMORY.md](./MEMORY.md). Currently granted to @DocTpoint (Write role on personal repo; "no push to main" enforced by branch protection, not role assignment).

### ⚠️ Withdrawn / non-issues (archaeology)

- **Windows: `Connection test failed: TypeError: Failed to construct 'Headers'`** — withdrawn 2026-07-10 (user input error: non-ASCII chars in API key field; not plugin/AI-SDK bug). AI-SDK 5.0.53 has a Windows guard but our `provider-utils@4.0.35` (bundled by `ai@^6.0.214`) doesn't include the fix; not worth patching given root cause is user-side.

## 📚 Documentation Architecture

**One fact, one place. Reference, don't copy.** When the same information appears in two files, one will drift and lie.

| File | Responsibility | What belongs | Does NOT belongs |
|------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **AGENTS.md** | Dev standards + current phase | Six-Gate / TDD / Git workflow / current state | Old release histories, project structure tree, full version timeline |
| **CLAUDE.md** | Historical mirror (pointer stub only) | One-line redirect to `AGENTS.md` | All new process content (CLAUDE.md is frozen) |
| **ROADMAP.md** | Planning | Next Milestone / Version Timeline (condensed) / Deferred & Backlog | Per-version detail (use CHANGELOG) |
| **CHANGELOG.md** | History (Keep a Changelog) | Per-version Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed — ancient versions are pre-aggregated, **do not re-merge** | Forward-looking plans, dev standards |
| **CONTRIBUTING.md** | Contributor guide | Project structure tree, architecture, Mermaid, dev setup | User docs, design philosophy |
| **10 READMEs (EN + 9 i18n)** | User docs | Features / Quick Start / FAQ | Implementation details, internal version numbers, What's New |
| **memory/** | Session-persistent lessons | [[feedback-*]] (rules) + [[project-*]] (current state) | Code references that drift (use code comments) |

**Cross-reference format:** `[section](./OTHER.md#anchor)` — keep one canonical source, link to it.

**CHANGELOG rule:** Already aggregated per Keep a Changelog spec. Ancient versions (v1.6.x / 0.2.x) are pre-aggregated — do NOT re-merge. "Optimization" that deletes historical version info is a regression, not improvement. Verify with `grep -c "^## \[" CHANGELOG.md` before assuming it needs work.
