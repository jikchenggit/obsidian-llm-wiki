// Generation prompts — entity, concept, and summary page creation

export const GENERATION_PROMPTS = {
  generateEntityPage: `You are a Wiki knowledge base maintainer. Create a Wiki page for the following entity.

**Entity Information:**
- Name: {{entity_name}}
- Tag: {{entity_type}} (a tags: value — the frontmatter type: below stays "entity")
- Summary: {{entity_summary}}
- Related entities: {{related_entities}}
- Related concepts: {{related_concepts}}
- Extraction aliases (seeds): {{extraction_aliases}}

**Existing Related Content in Wiki:**
{{related_content}}

{{merge_strategy}}

**Task Requirements:**
1. Create an entity page with basic and key information
2. When referencing another page, write [[Name]] using the name as you would say it. Do NOT write a folder path and do NOT guess one — the system resolves every name to its real page after generation, against the whole wiki. A display name is optional: [[Qwen]] and [[Qwen|the Qwen family]] are both correct.
3. IMPORTANT: All related entities and concepts MUST be formatted as wiki-links using the [[path|display]] format — even if the target page does not yet exist in the Wiki. This allows the Lint system to detect dead links and create stub pages later. Never output a related entity/concept name as plain text.
4. If the entity already exists in the Wiki, use the merge strategy above for intelligent merging
4. Be objective, accurate, and concise
5. **Generate aliases for this page** — provide 1-3 alternative names. This field is REQUIRED:
   - Include acronyms, abbreviations, and same-language alternative names
   - English is universally acceptable as a "linker language" — when a term originates in English
     (e.g. "Transformer", "DNA", "API", "RoPE", "CUDA"), keep it as-is even in non-English wikis
   - **CRITICAL: do NOT invent translations for established technical terms.** If a term is universally
     used in English across scientific literature, do NOT coin a Chinese/Japanese/German equivalent
     that doesn't exist in real-world usage. Real-world convention always wins over linguistic purity.
   - **If no natural alias exists**, use the page title itself as the first alias. The aliases field MUST NOT be left empty — always provide at least one alias

   Examples:
   - 维生素 B2 (Chinese wiki) → ["维他命 B2", "Vitamin B2", "VB2"]
   - Transformer (Chinese wiki) → ["Transformers", "BERT"]      ← NO 变换器 (no such usage in Chinese)
   - Rotary Position Embedding (Japanese wiki) → ["RoPE", "回転位置埋め込み"]
   - Neural Network (Chinese wiki) → ["神经网络", "NN"]

**Output Format:**
---
type: entity  # MUST be exactly "entity" - do not change this value
created: {{date}}
updated: {{date}}
sources: ["[[{{source_file}}]]"]
tags: [{{entity_type}}]  # Copy the Tag value from Entity Information verbatim

**Task Requirements:**
1. Create a concept page including definition, characteristics, and applications
2. When referencing another page, write [[Name]] using the name as you would say it. Do NOT write a folder path and do NOT guess one — the system resolves every name to its real page after generation, against the whole wiki. A display name is optional: [[Attention]] and [[Attention|attention mechanism]] are both correct.
3. IMPORTANT: All related entities and concepts MUST use [[wiki-link]] format even if the target page does not yet exist — this allows the Lint system to detect and fix them later. Never output a related entity/concept name as plain text.

6. **Generate aliases for this page** — provide 1-2 alternative names for the source. This field is REQUIRED:

  suggestSchemaUpdate: `You are a Wiki Schema advisor. Review the current schema and the latest ingestion analysis.

Current Schema:
{{schema_content}}

Analysis Context:
{{analysis_context}}

Task: Determine if the schema needs updating to better accommodate recent content.
Consider:
1. Are there new entity types that should be added to the classification rules?
2. Are there new concept types that should be added?
3. Should naming conventions be adjusted?
4. Should page templates be updated (missing sections, better structure)?
5. Should maintenance policies be revised (stale thresholds, severity levels)?

Output JSON format:
{
  "changes_needed": true,
  "new_schema_body": "The COMPLETE schema body, in markdown, as it would read IF this proposal were accepted — starting with the H1 title, including every section that would exist after accepting (unchanged sections may be kept exactly as-is). Nothing has been applied yet.",
  "suggestions": "Markdown description of the PROPOSED schema changes with reasoning (1-3 sentences). Phrase this as a proposal that has not been applied yet ('would add...', 'proposes to...') — never past tense ('added...', 'changed...'), since Apply has not been clicked."
}

If no changes are needed:
{
  "changes_needed": false,
  "suggestions": "Short explanation of why no changes are needed"
}

CRITICAL:
- The "suggestions" field must be written in the user's UI language below (after this CRITICAL block). Do NOT default to English unless the user's UI language is English.
- new_schema_body is the COMPLETE schema as it would read IF this proposal were accepted — not a diff, not a patch, and not yet applied. The apply path replaces the current body with new_schema_body verbatim only if and when the user clicks Apply.
- DO NOT include YAML frontmatter (--- ... ---) in new_schema_body. Start directly with the H1 title (e.g. "# Wiki Schema Configuration").
- DO NOT wrap new_schema_body in markdown code fences (\`\`\`). The parser strips them, but cleaner output reduces parse risk on small models.
- Preserve all existing sections that are still relevant. Only change what the analysis actually warrants.
- Output ONLY the JSON, no other text.

User UI language: {{user_language}}`,
