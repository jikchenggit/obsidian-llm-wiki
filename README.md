## 🤔 Why this plugin?

You write notes. They sit in folders. Finding what relates to what means remembering threads you forgot months ago.

**Other open-source reimplementations of Karpathy's LLM Wiki idea exist — but none ships as a one-click Obsidian plugin.** Most are CLI tools, Claude Code skills, or separate desktop apps; this one runs inside Obsidian — Graph View, ribbons, command palette included.

### How we compare

|  | **Karpathy LLM Wiki** (this plugin) | nashsu / llm_wiki | SamurAIGPT / llm-wiki-agent | atomicstrata / llm-wiki-compiler |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Delivery** | ✅ One-click Obsidian plugin | 🟡 Tauri desktop app | 🟡 Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode / Gemini CLI skill | 🟡 TypeScript CLI pipeline |
| **Dependencies** | ✅ None — plugin only | 🟡 Python runtime + sqlite | 🟡 Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode runtime | ❌ Embedding model + vector DB (per their docs) |
| **i18n (UI + wiki output)** | ✅ 11 languages | 🟡 EN / 中文 | ❌ EN only | ❌ EN only |
| **LLM providers** | ✅ 16+ (Anthropic, OpenAI, Bedrock, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, Grok, Kimi, GLM, MiniMax, Step, Hunyuan, MiMo, Gemma, Codex OAuth, Ollama, LM Studio, OpenRouter, Anthropic-Compatible, …) | 🟡 OpenAI-compatible | 🟡 Subscription via Claude Code / Codex | 🟡 OpenAI-compatible |
| **Retrieval & query pipeline** | ✅ **PPR + Monte Carlo** over `[[wiki-link]]` graph | 🟡 2-hop decay (4-signal heuristic) | 🟡 Louvain community detection | 🟡 BM25 + semantic over chunks |
| **Graph visualization** | ✅ Obsidian's native Graph View (built in, zero extra size) | 🟡 Custom sigma.js + graphology in desktop app | 🟡 vis.js `graph.html` (separate file) | ❌ Read-only browser viewer |
| **Ingest formats** | ✅ **Markdown + PDF + images + Office (DOCX/PPTX/XLSX)** — one switch flips between native PDF (Anthropic / OpenAI / Bedrock / Gemini) and the built-in MinerU multi-format backend | 🟡 Markdown + PDF | 🟡 Markdown / code files only | 🟡 Markdown only |

Three we left off the table: **sdyckjq/llm-wiki-skill** was a Codex skill that 404s today (deleted by author); **atomicstrata** is included even though its retrieval is chunk-based because it's the most active TypeScript alternative; **nashsu** ships the largest user base of the three (10k+ stars, others 2k+) but is a Tauri desktop app, not an Obsidian plugin.

### Three things we chose on purpose, not by accident

- **🪟 Obsidian is the runtime.** No terminal, no separate app, no Docker, no Python. Install from Community Plugins, click Ingest, the wiki lives in your vault from the first second. Obsidian's native Graph View renders your `[[wiki-link]]` graph — built in, zero extra bundle size.
- **🧭 Clean and self-contained.** Zero dependencies. No embedding model, no vector database, no pip package — a single plugin that reads your notes, talks to an LLM, and writes wiki pages. Everything lives inside Obsidian.
- **🔌 Any model you already pay for.** Anthropic, Bedrock, OpenAI, ChatGPT Plan (Codex OAuth), Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, Grok, Kimi, GLM, MiniMax, Step, Hunyuan, MiMo, Gemma, Ollama, LM Studio, OpenRouter, Anthropic-compatible, custom endpoint — sixteen-plus providers, none of them required to have an embedding endpoint.

---

## 🎯 Is it for me?

**✅ Yes, if you:**

- **Want a 5-minute setup, not a 5-hour project.** Install from Community Plugins → pick a provider → Ingest one note. No CLI, no Python, no separate runtime, no vector DB. You see wiki pages in `wiki/` within seconds.
- **Want something clean and self-contained.** The plugin has exactly zero external dependencies: no embedding model, no vector database, no pip package, no Docker container. It's a single Obsidian plugin that reads your notes, talks to an LLM, and writes wiki pages into your vault. Everything lives inside Obsidian.
- **Want a queryable chat that answers from *your* notes** — not the internet — with every answer carrying `[[wiki-links]]` back into your knowledge graph.
- **Care about data sovereignty** — runs fully local with Ollama or LM Studio, never touching the internet.
- **Write in or read from any of 10 supported languages** — the UI and wiki output language are independent (your wiki can be in Chinese while the interface is in English).
- **Maintain the graph by writing `[[wiki-links]]`** — every link you write already enriches retrieval; no separate tagging/embedding/indexing step.
- **Want one-click maintenance** — Lint health scan + Smart Fix All keep duplicates, dead links, and orphan pages in check without you hand-curating.

**❌ No, if you:**

- **Want a general-purpose ChatGPT replacement** — answers come from your vault only, not the internet.
- **Need RAG over large external corpora** (Confluence, Notion, arXiv, scraped web pages) — the plugin ingests your vault plus standalone PDF/Office files; bulk external-corpus RAG is out of scope by design.
- **Want a hosted SaaS with team collaboration** — there's no backend, no server, no shared state; everything runs locally inside your Obsidian.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install.** Obsidian → Settings → Community plugins → Browse → search "Karpathy LLM Wiki" → Install → Enable. Or visit the [Community Plugin page](https://community.obsidian.md/plugins/karpathywiki) and click **Add to Obsidian**.
2. **Configure a provider.** Open Settings → Karpathy LLM Wiki → pick a provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, ChatGPT Plan (Codex OAuth), etc.) → enter API key (not needed for local) → click **Test Connection** → Save.
3. **Ingest one note.** Two ways:
   - **⌨️ Keyboard:** `Cmd+P/Ctrl+P` → "Ingest single source" → pick any Markdown (or PDF, v1.25.0+) file.
   - **🖱️ Toolbar icon:** Click the **sticker icon** in Obsidian's left ribbon to instantly ingest the currently-open note — no menu hunting.
   
   Your first wiki pages appear in `wiki/sources/`, `wiki/entities/`, `wiki/concepts/` within seconds.
4. **Query your wiki.** Two ways:
   - **⌨️ Keyboard:** `Cmd+P/Ctrl+P` → "Query wiki".
   - **🖱️ Toolbar icon:** Click the **message-circle icon** in Obsidian's left ribbon.
   
   A right-docked side panel opens (Copilot-style) where you can chat with your wiki. Answers carry `[[wiki-links]]` back into your knowledge graph.

![Right-docked Query Wiki side panel in Obsidian showing a chat interface with wiki-link answers back to your knowledge graph](/docs/assets/query-side-panel.png)

That's it. The plugin modifies nothing in your original notes — only creates new pages under `wiki/`. Both **Ingest** and **Query wiki** are pinned to the left ribbon for one-click access anytime. (`Cmd` on macOS, `Ctrl` on Windows/Linux.)

### Core commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **📥 Ingest single source** | `Cmd+P/Ctrl+P` → "Ingest single source" — pick a Markdown or **PDF (v1.25.0+)** file, get entity/concept/wiki pages. *Also: 🖱️ ribbon sticker icon on the active note.* |
| **📂 Ingest from folder** | `Cmd+P/Ctrl+P` → "Ingest from folder" — batch-ingest every note in a folder, with smart batch skip |
| **📑 Ingest multiple files** | `Cmd+P/Ctrl+P` → "Ingest multiple files" — pick a subset via a two-pane file tree (with live queue + per-file cancel) |
| **🔍 Query wiki** | `Cmd+P/Ctrl+P` → "Query wiki" — chat with your wiki in a right-docked side panel; answers carry `[[wiki-links]]`. *Also: 🖱️ ribbon message-circle icon.* |
| **🛠️ Lint wiki** | `Cmd+P/Ctrl+P` → "Lint wiki" — full health scan: duplicates, dead links, empty pages, orphans, missing aliases, contradictions |
| **⚡ Smart Fix All** | inside Lint Modal — one-click causal-order repair with per-phase report |
| **📋 Regenerate index** | `Cmd+P/Ctrl+P` → "Regenerate index" — rebuild `wiki/index.md` with current pages and aliases |
| **⏹ Cancel** | `Cmd+P/Ctrl+P` → "Cancel current ingestion" or click the status bar — stops cleanly at the next batch boundary |
| **📊 Ingestion history** | `Cmd+P/Ctrl+P` → "View Ingestion History" — searchable UI for past ingestions, lint reports, maintenance runs |

![Command panel — all LLM Wiki commands live in Obsidian's command palette](/docs/assets/command-panel.png)

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `notes/machine-learning.md` (a flat file) | `wiki/concepts/supervised-learning.md` with `[[bidirectional links]]`, aliases, source attribution, and an entry in `wiki/index.md` |

## ✨ Features

### 📚 Knowledge quality

- **🔍 Entity & concept extraction** — LLM extracts entities (people, orgs, products, events) and concepts (theories, methods, terms) into standalone pages. Granularity is configurable (Minimal → Fine, plus Custom) so you trade cost vs. depth.
- **🏷️ Mandatory aliases** — every page ships with at least one alias (translation, abbreviation, variant) so cross-language duplicate detection works.
- **🔄 Tiered duplicate detection** — Tier 1 (direct name match: cross-language, abbreviation, high-similarity titles) is always verified; Tier 2 (shared links, medium similarity) fills remaining token budget.
- **🧩 Smart merge & contradiction state** — duplicates merge while preserving aliases; contradictions are flagged with source attribution; `reviewed: true` pages are protected from overwrite.
- **🎨 One tag vocabulary, yours** — the tags a page may carry come from three places you control: the nested tags of your notes, the nested tags already on wiki pages, and the list in Settings → Wiki → Tag Vocabulary → *Custom* (the place for a term no note carries yet). Prompt, write gate, lint and retag all read this one list, so what the model is offered is exactly what lands on disk; a value outside it is dropped, never written. Source pages carry it too, next to their form tag. Small/local models still drift (about one in ten returns the model's built-in taxonomy) — the gate catches it, and Lint reports a page left without tags. Design anchor: [Issue #328](https://github.com/GD4AI/obsidian-llm-wiki/issues/328).

### 📄 Document / PDF / Image ingest

Five on-ramps, switchable per ingest:

1. **🆕 Built-in MinerU backend (v1.27.0, #404)** — Settings → Wiki Configuration → Markdown Conversion Backend → *MinerU*. PDF + images (PNG/JPG/JPEG/JP2/WebP/GIF/BMP) + Office (DOC/DOCX/PPT/PPTX/XLS/XLSX) through [MinerU's Precise parser](https://mineru.net/apiManage/docs). Token in Obsidian SecretStorage. Best path for scientific papers, scanned documents, and Office files where layout preservation matters. Server caps: 200 MB / 200 pages per PDF, 256 MB / 10,000 files per archive.
2. **☁️ Cloud providers with native PDF** — Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, and AWS Bedrock (Anthropic + OpenAI variants) read PDFs as file parts out of the box. No setup beyond provider selection.
3. **🖥️ Local OCR on Apple Silicon** — [oMLX](https://github.com/jundot/omlx) bundles Microsoft Markitdown as a built-in PDF→Markdown backend. Enable Markitdown in oMLX, load [Baidu Unlimited-OCR](https://huggingface.co/baidu/Unlimited-OCR) (3B / 570M-active, open-sourced 2026-06) as the vision model, point the plugin at oMLX as a Custom OpenAI-Compatible provider, turn on **Force PDF Support**, pick the multimodal model oMLX is serving. The PDF never leaves your machine.
4. **🛠️ Third-party extractor (MinerU online UI)** — use the [MinerU Extractor online service](https://mineru.net/OpenSourceTools/Extractor) for a quick manual UI when you don't want to wire up an API token. Download the converted `.md`, drop it in your vault outside the wiki folder, and ingest as a regular Markdown note.
5. **🔌 Force PDF Support** — for any other OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible endpoint that accepts file parts, the plugin attempts the call (Settings → LLM Configuration → Advanced). The endpoint decides; failures surface as a localized Notice.
6. **🖼️ Embedded Markdown images** — turn on *Analyze embedded images during Markdown ingestion* in Advanced settings to analyze every eligible local `![[image.png]]` and `![alt](image.png)` embed. Each image is analyzed with its nearest Markdown paragraphs, sent in 20 MiB visual-evidence packages, and capped at 10 MiB; remote URLs are never downloaded. For testable per-image output, optionally enable *Save embedded image visual evidence to source page* to add a collapsible audit section to the generated source page.

**Caveat for Office formats:** Obsidian does not natively render `.docx` / `.xlsx` / `.pptx` ([file-formats](https://obsidian.md/help/file-formats)), so the practical workflow for Office files is: MinerU converts to `.md`, the plugin ingests that `.md` into wiki pages, and the original Office file is kept around for reference. Use a community plugin like Pandoc Plugin / Docxer / Md Importer / Office Reader if you need to inline-preview Office files.

**Plumbing shared across all paths:**

- **🗄️ Bounded cache** — `.obsidian/plugins/karpathywiki/pdf-cache/` stores converted Markdown keyed by content hash + model + converter version; 100 MB total / 1000 entries / 10 MB single-entry caps with LRU-by-mtime eviction.
- **📝 Optional vault sidecar** — Settings → Wiki Configuration → Wiki Folder → *Write PDF Markdown to Vault* writes `<basename>.pdf.md` next to the source PDF (off by default — cache-only is the default).
- **🛡️ Verbatim transcriber prompt** — OCR-style conversion with `[illegible]` / `[figure: ...]` anti-hallucination markers; markdown-fence-wrapping from small local models is auto-cleaned before cache write.
- **🔁 Source-page verbatim quotes (v1.27.0, #496)** — every generated `sources/<slug>.md` page now carries a `Mentions in Source` section built from the same verbatim quotes the extraction captured per entity/concept (the prose the model already proved it could see), so the underlying document is the one wiki page with a real, grounded trail back to its source text.

### 💬 Query & maintenance

- **🧭 5-stage PPR cascade** — see [How retrieval works](#-how-retrieval-works). Personalized PageRank over `[[wiki-link]]` gives graph-aware multi-hop context.
- **🪟 Right-docked side panel** — Query Wiki opens in a Copilot-style right sidebar leaf (v1.22.1+) instead of a centered modal.
- **🔍 Lint health scan** — single command catches: duplicates, dead links, empty pages, orphans, missing aliases, contradictions.
- **⚡ Smart Fix All** — one-click causal-order repair: fill aliases → merge duplicates → fix dead links → link orphans → expand empty pages, with per-phase report.
- **🆕 Fix Dead Links leave-it outcome (v1.27.0, #485)** — Settings → Advanced → *Create Stubs for Unresolvable Links* (default ON) lets you opt out of empty placeholder pages: when off, the dead link stays visible in every lint report until a real source defines it, and ingest creates pages through normal channels. The never-LLM-expand gate from #197 is unchanged — the new control only governs whether the stub page is *written at all*.
- **📊 Operation history panel** — searchable, filterable UI for past ingestions, lint reports, and maintenance runs.
- **🛡️ Pre-ingest gate** — empty / whitespace / frontmatter-only notes are rejected before any LLM call; content-hash dedup catches identical files across paths.
- **🆕 Ingest candidate gate (v1.27.0, #514 / PR #521)** — opt-in toggle (`skipMentionOnlyCandidates`, default off, Settings → Advanced). For sources whose language has a measured profile (de measured; en/fr/es/pt/nl/ko estimated with pinned edge cases; zh/ja character-script thresholds unmeasured), candidates named only inside parentheses / enumerations / short list items are pruned before they cost a page plus dedup and generation calls. Cross-language notes are not gated; wiki languages without a profile report once per ingest and never silently skip.
- **🆕 Per-step task policies (v1.27.0, #525 / #490)** — LLM Advanced → Task Policies field; override the per-step text-mode/thinking setting without code changes. Built-in baseline stays intact for steps you don't list.

### 🔒 Privacy

- **🚫 No backend, no tracking, no analytics.** Runs entirely inside Obsidian. Network is used only to communicate with the LLM provider you configure.
- **📁 Source files are read-only.** The plugin never modifies your original vault notes — only creates new pages under `wiki/`.
- **🦙 Full local mode.** Ollama, LM Studio, or any local OpenAI-compatible endpoint → your notes never leave your machine.
- **🔐 Minimal permissions.** Vault file access for wiki management. Clipboard access only when you click the "Copy" button in the Query modal.

### 🦙 Local-first

- **🖥️ Ollama, LM Studio, OpenRouter, custom endpoint** — out-of-the-box. Local models work for query (smaller context windows); ingest on a 2,000-page vault usually needs a long-context cloud model.
- **📄 PDF OCR path is fully local on Apple Silicon** — see [Document / PDF / Image ingest](#-document--pdf--image-ingest) above.
- **🔐 ChatGPT Plan (Codex OAuth)** — desktop loopback or mobile device-code; credentials live only in Obsidian SecretStorage. (See [Anthropic vs OpenAI vs Codex OAuth](#anthropic-vs-openai-vs-codex-oauth--they-are-distinct-providers) below for the full provider-boundary explanation.)

### 🌐 Language

- **🌍 11 UI languages** — English, 简体中文, 繁體中文, 日本語, 한국어, Deutsch, Français, Español, Português, Italiano, Русский. UI and wiki-output language are independent — your wiki can be Chinese while the interface is English.
- **📚 11 wiki-output languages** — same set; pick in Settings → Wiki Configuration. *Custom input* option for ad-hoc prompts.
- **All UI strings translated per locale** — every label, modal, and notice. Adding a 12th language is contributor-driven (PR #159 pattern).

---

## 🌐 Ecosystem

The plugin composes with the rest of your Obsidian stack — each tool below plugs into the `[[wiki-link]]` graph without code changes.

- **📄 [MinerU multi-format backend](https://mineru.net/apiManage/docs) (built-in since v1.27.0)** — what used to be a separate CLI/UI step is now a plugin switch; see [Document / PDF / Image ingest](#-document--pdf--image-ingest) for the full path table. The [MinerU online service](https://mineru.net/OpenSourceTools/Extractor) remains available for users who prefer a quick UI over an API token; [self-host MinerU](https://github.com/opendatalab/mineru) is also an option.
- **🕸️ Obsidian Graph View** — open the native graph on any wiki page; every `[[wiki-link]]` becomes a node, every back-link an edge. Built in, zero extra bundle size.
- **✂️ [Obsidian Web Clipper](https://obsidian.md/clipper)** — official browser extension. Save web pages (articles, blog posts, Reddit threads, Hacker News, recipes, research papers, YouTube transcripts via Interpreter) into any folder of your vault, then run the plugin's `Ingest from folder` command to batch-extract entities and concepts.
- **📊 [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)** — query the wiki like a database with DQL (`LIST FROM "wiki/entities" WHERE contains(tags, "person")`) or JS API. The plugin writes standard frontmatter (`tags:`, `type:`, `aliases:`) on every page, so Dataview queries work out of the box.
- **🌿 Git** — version your vault (any Git client). The plugin never rewrites your source files; only creates new pages under `wiki/`, so `git diff` cleanly separates your edits from LLM-generated content.
- **🎞️ [Marp Slides](https://github.com/samuele-cozzi/obsidian-marp-slides)** — turn any Obsidian note into slide decks via Marp frontmatter (`marp: true`). Wiki pages are pure Markdown, so they render as slides without extra conversion.
- **🖼️ Canvas** — Obsidian's native infinite canvas. Drag wiki cards onto a Canvas to assemble study guides, mind maps, or research overviews from `[[wiki-links]]` without leaving the vault.
- **🎤 [Obsidian Nous](https://github.com/AndyMDH/obsidian-nous)** — companion plugin for local voice memo and meeting capture (whisper.cpp on macOS; audio never leaves the machine). Generates speaker-labeled transcripts and its own wiki hub pages. Independent of this plugin — both can share the same vault without coupling.

---

## 🧰 Headless CLI

**Most users should ignore this section.** The plugin's user-facing CLI lives in the sibling repo [green-dalii/obsidian-llm-wiki-cli](https://github.com/green-dalii/obsidian-llm-wiki-cli) — install with `npm i -g karpathywiki-cli` and run `karpathywiki-cli ingest --sources <path> --wiki <path> --provider <id> --key <key>`.

What ships in this repo at `tools/dev-instrument/` is the **dev-only headless measurement instrument** for engine contributors — it runs the real `WikiEngine.ingestSource` against a vault on disk with no Obsidian runtime, prints per-task token + wall-clock accounting — same numbers that drive the perf evidence in CLAUDE.md and release notes. See [`tools/dev-instrument/README.md`](https://github.com/GD4AI/obsidian-llm-wiki/blob/main/tools/dev-instrument/README.md) for the entry command, env vars, measurement modes, and exit-code spec.

---

## 🔍 How retrieval works

Most "AI search" plugins fragment your notes into chunks and embed them in a vector DB. We don't. [Karpathy's argument against RAG](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/442a6bf555914893e9891c11519de94f) is that chunking breaks the LLM's ability to reason across your whole knowledge graph — and that argument holds up in practice. Instead, we walk the graph you already maintain by writing `[[wiki-links]]`.

### The 5-stage seed-selection cascade

When you ask "Who founded Microsoft?", Query Wiki runs five stages before any answer generation:

1. **Lex fast path** — straight token-overlap against every entity/concept title and aliases. Free, instant, and the gating step for everything that follows.
2. **LLM keyword generation** — the LLM proposes 8–12 cross-language keywords from your query (handles synonyms, abbreviations, and token-overlap-resistant terms in one LLM call).
3. **Local substring scan** — every generated keyword is re-matched locally against page titles, aliases, and body snippets. No extra LLM call; rounds out noise-tolerant recall.
4. **LLM KB fallback** — when lex + keyword scan returns weak signals, the LLM re-seeds the top-N candidates against the full wiki for one semantic pass.
5. **PPR graph expansion** — Personalized PageRank (Haveliwala 2002) over the `[[wiki-link]]` graph starting from the candidate seed set. This is what gives graph-aware multi-hop context: "Bill Gates" → "Microsoft" → "competitors", not just literal title overlap.

The cascade truncates at whichever stage returned enough signal — no fixed 5-stage cost; no LLM calls when lex is sufficient; semantic fallback only when lex + keyword scan alone isn't enough.

### Personalized PageRank at scale

We use Monte Carlo PPR (Fogaras 2005) — 3,000 random walks × 50 steps each — with the dead-end rule from Haveliwala 2002. Cost is **O(K × L)** (K = walks, L = steps per walk), independent of the number of pages, so a 2,000-page vault sees the same expansion latency as a 200-page one.

**PPR @5 = 27.1% vs pure-kNN baseline 24.1%** on the project's own benchmark corpus (the only published retrieval benchmark in this open-source LLM-Wiki space).

### Why no embeddings

We deliberately rejected the embedding path in [Issue #175](https://github.com/GD4AI/obsidian-llm-wiki/issues/175). The graph signal is already there — every `[[wiki-link]]` is a hand-curated "these are related" edge, and most providers we support (Ollama, LM Studio, Anthropic, Bedrock, Kimi, GLM, MiniMax) don't ship a `/v1/embeddings` endpoint at all. Adding an embedding model would mean a per-page download, a per-provider adapter, and zero benefit on retrieval quality.

This plugin feeds the LLM your full Wiki context per query — so **long-context models win**. The full tiered table (cloud + local) lives in [docs/MODEL-GUIDE.md](https://github.com/GD4AI/obsidian-llm-wiki/blob/main/docs/MODEL-GUIDE.md), cross-checked against [models.dev](https://models.dev/) so the picks stay current.


### What matters

- **🧠 Context window ≥ 200K tokens** for vaults over ~500 pages. Below 200K the cascade may drop earlier stages to fit.
- **⚖️ Instruction-following quality** matters more than raw IQ for the extraction task — pick a model that follows the schema template, not the biggest leaderboard number.
- **🔌 Embedding endpoint is irrelevant** — we don't use embeddings. A provider that lacks `/v1/embeddings` is fine (most of our 16+ providers don't ship one).
- **🦙 Local works for query, cloud for ingest** — ingest on a 2,000-page vault usually needs a long-context cloud model; a 262K local model covers most queries.

For PDF / image / Office ingest, see [Document / PDF / Image ingest](#-document--pdf--image-ingest) in Features — Anthropic, OpenAI, Bedrock, and Gemini read PDFs as file parts natively; the built-in MinerU backend (v1.27.0+) and **Force PDF Support** cover everything else.

### Anthropic vs OpenAI vs Codex OAuth — they are distinct providers

- **Anthropic** (and its Bedrock variant) — separately billed Anthropic Platform API key.
- **OpenAI** — separately billed OpenAI Platform API key.
- **ChatGPT Plan (Codex OAuth)** — experimental, distinct provider that uses eligible Codex allowance after browser or device-code sign-in; availability follows OpenAI Codex authentication and allowance policies, not plan name. Third-party Codex compatibility, not an OpenAI partnership or a general ChatGPT API.

### AWS Bedrock — three auth modes (v1.27.0, #425)

Settings → Provider → Bedrock (Anthropic / OpenAI) now picks one of three auth modes; the provider row then asks for the inputs that mode actually needs:

- **API key** — the original Stage-1 bearer path; behavior is byte-for-byte identical to v1.26.4 and the recommended pick for users who already pay for a Bedrock API key.
- **SSO** — IAM Identity Center device flow. Click *Sign in with AWS SSO*, paste the verification URL code in the browser, the plugin receives an SSO token via `karpathywiki-bedrock-sso` in SecretStorage, exchanges it for temporary role credentials, and signs every request with hand-rolled SigV4 (no AWS SDK added). Account ID and role name are auto-detected when the SSO identity exposes exactly one of each; otherwise enter them in the provider settings.
- **IAM** — static access keys for environments without SSO (CI, scheduled batch jobs). Stored in `karpathywiki-bedrock-iam` in SecretStorage; the in-memory cache memoizes per access-key to keep SigV4 signing within expiry.

All three modes share the same Obsidian SecretStorage discipline (no credentials in `data.json`, logs, or docs) and the same zero-AWS-SDK hand-rolled OIDC + SigV4 path. Bedrock region is independent of auth mode and is configured in the same provider row.

## ❓ FAQ

### What does the plugin actually do?

Pick any note, folder, or selection; the LLM extracts entities and concepts and generates an interlinked wiki with `[[bidirectional links]]`. Ask questions and get conversational answers grounded in *your* notes, not the internet. Your original vault notes are never modified.

### How do I get started?

Install from Obsidian Community Plugins → pick a provider → **Test Connection** → run **Ingest single source** on any note. First wiki pages appear within seconds. See [Quick Start](#-quick-start).

### Is my existing wiki safe?

✅ Backward compatible since v1.0.0. Set `reviewed: true` on any page to protect it from overwrite. Upgrading from v1.24.x doesn't rewrite your vault; v1.25.0's PDF ingest is cache-only by default, and v1.27.0 adds native PDF + images + Office ingest without changing the on-disk wiki layout.

### Can I ingest PDFs, images, and Office documents?

✅ Yes. Anthropic, OpenAI, Bedrock, and Gemini read PDFs natively; the built-in MinerU backend (v1.27.0) covers everything else (PDF + images + Office). Full walkthrough — cloud providers, Apple Silicon OCR, Force PDF Support, cache housekeeping — in [docs/PDF-OCR-GUIDE.md](https://github.com/GD4AI/obsidian-llm-wiki/blob/main/docs/PDF-OCR-GUIDE.md).

### Is my data sent anywhere?

🚫 No backend, no analytics — the plugin runs entirely inside Obsidian. Only text you explicitly send for ingest/query leaves your device, and only to the LLM provider you configure. For complete data locality, use Ollama or LM Studio.

### Can I use the plugin in my language?

🌍 11 languages for both UI and wiki output. UI and wiki language are independent. Adding a 12th language is contributor-driven (PR #159 pattern).

### How is this different from a RAG chatbot?

🚫 No chunking. 🚫 No embeddings. 🚫 No vector DB. ✅ Personalized PageRank over your existing `[[wiki-link]]` graph — graph-aware multi-hop context, zero embedding cost, full local-model support.

### Which LLM should I use?

Long-context models (≥200K tokens) work best. The [Models section](#-models) covers the principles; the full tiered table is in [docs/MODEL-GUIDE.md](https://github.com/GD4AI/obsidian-llm-wiki/blob/main/docs/MODEL-GUIDE.md).

### Is there a published benchmark?

Yes — PPR @5 = 27.1% vs pure-kNN baseline 24.1% on the project's own corpus. The full pipeline and benchmark script are described in [How retrieval works](#-how-retrieval-works).

### How do I control API costs?

Use Coarse or Minimal extraction granularity for batch ingest. Smart Batch Skip auto-detects already-ingested files. Auto-Maintenance is OFF by default. Lint shows counts before running fixes — nothing is charged without your approval.

### How do I cancel a running operation?

Click the status bar (shows "Ingesting… click to cancel") or `Cmd+P/Ctrl+P` → "Cancel current ingestion". Stops cleanly at the next batch boundary.

### Where do I get help?

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/GD4AI/obsidian-llm-wiki/issues) for bug reports · [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/GD4AI/obsidian-llm-wiki/discussions) for questions and feature requests · Developer Console (`Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Option+I`) for plugin logs.

## 🔒 Privacy

This plugin is listed on the Obsidian Community Plugin Market and undergoes automated review for security and permissions.

- **🚫 No backend of its own, no telemetry, no data collection.** Pure local software running inside Obsidian. The plugin operates no server and reports nothing anywhere.
- **🔐 Network access is opt-in and explicit.** It exists only to reach services *you* configure: your LLM provider, and — if you turn on the MinerU document backend — `mineru.net`. That second one is the exception worth naming: it uploads the document to a jurisdiction you did not choose and that publishes no retention statement. [Where your document is processed](https://github.com/GD4AI/obsidian-llm-wiki/blob/main/docs/PDF-OCR-GUIDE.md#-where-your-document-is-processed) lists every path and where the file goes.
- **📁 Vault file access** is used for wiki management (reading notes, generating pages, scanning dead links, detecting duplicates). The plugin never modifies your source files.
- **📋 Clipboard access** is used exclusively by the "Copy" button in the Query modal — and only when you click it.

For complete data locality, use Ollama or LM Studio. With a local provider, your data never leaves your machine.

## 🔭 Other projects

- **[obsidian-llm-wiki-cli](https://github.com/green-dalii/obsidian-llm-wiki-cli)** — the headless ingest CLI, sibling repo shipped as the `karpathywiki-cli` npm package. Runs the same `WikiEngine` against a vault on disk, no renderer. Install with `npm i -g karpathywiki-cli`. The in-tree `tools/dev-instrument/` is the dev-only measurement instrument that drives the per-task cost numbers in this plugin's release notes.
- **[pi-shift-router](https://github.com/green-dalii/pi-shift-router)** — a task-level router for [pi-coding-agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). Before each turn a small LLM judge marks your message routine or consequential, and the tier it picks drives the whole turn. Complex tasks go further: the Smart tier runs as a CTO that plans the work, delegates implementation to Fast subagents, reviews each result and iterates. Upgrades are instant, downgrades wait for a sustained trend; per-tier fallback chains ride out 429s and 5xx. Zero runtime deps, MIT. → [shiftrouter.greenerai.top](https://shiftrouter.greenerai.top)
- **[dsh-shift-router](https://github.com/green-dalii/dsh-shift-router)** — DSH fork of pi-shift-router, same task-level routing design but targeted at the [dsh-coding-agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/dsh) runtime. Same judge-driven tier picks, same per-tier fallback chains, MIT.
- **[dsh-plugin-dev-skill](https://github.com/green-dalii/dsh-plugin-dev-skill)** — DSH companion to the Claude-side `obsidian-plugin-dev` workflow: scaffolds an Obsidian plugin workspace, drives the Red→Green TDD loop, runs the Six-Gate quality closure (lint/tsc/test/build/css-lint), and prepares a release-ready branch on `feat/*` or `fix/*`. Built so DSH-using contributors get the same scaffolding + gate experience without copy-pasting from CLAUDE.md.
